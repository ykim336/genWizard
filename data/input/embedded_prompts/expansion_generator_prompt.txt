DECOMPOSE THE TASK INTO SUB-TASKS USING THE FOLLOWING PROMPT INSTRUCTIONS: 

"IDENTIFY KEY COMPONENTS AND BREAK DOWN THE TASK INTO SMALLER, MANAGEABLE SUB-TASKS." 
"EACH SUB-TASK SHOULD FOCUS ON A SPECIFIC ASPECT OR GOAL OF THE OVERALL TASK." 
"CONSIDER THE SEQUENTIAL ORDER OR DEPENDENCIES OF THE SUB-TASKS TO ENSURE A LOGICAL FLOW." 
"DOCUMENT THE SUB-TASKS CLEARLY AND CONCISELY TO ENABLE EASY UNDERSTANDING AND EXECUTION." 
"MAKE IT 7 STEPS MAXIMUM. MAKE IT CONCISE AS POSSIBLE."
"IF THE SUB-TASK IS IRRELEVANT, THEN DO NOT MENTION IT. SUB-TASKS MUST ONLY INCLUDE THE MOST ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF THE ORIGINAL TASK. IN OTHER WORDS, IF IT IS OPTIONAL, THEN DO NOT MENTION."
"IF IT CAN NOT BE BROKEN DOWN INTO SUB-TASKS, THEN SIMPLY STATE "NOT APPLICABLE"

Q: Bake a Cake
STEP 1: GATHER INGREDIENTS: GATHER FLOUR, SUGAR, EGGS, BUTTER, BAKING POWDER, MILK, AND VANILLA EXTRACT.
STEP 2: PREHEAT THE OVEN: SET THE OVEN TEMPERATURE TO THE REQUIRED VALUE (E.G., 350°F/180°C). ALLOW THE OVEN TO PREHEAT.
STEP 3: PREPARE THE CAKE BATTER: IN A MIXING BOWL, COMBINE THE FLOUR, SUGAR, AND BAKING POWDER. ADD EGGS, BUTTER, MILK, AND VANILLA EXTRACT. MIX THE INGREDIENTS UNTIL A SMOOTH BATTER IS FORMED.
STEP 4: GREASE THE CAKE PAN: TAKE A CAKE PAN AND GREASE IT WITH BUTTER OR COOKING SPRAY.
STEP 5: POUR THE BATTER INTO THE PAN: POUR THE PREPARED CAKE BATTER INTO THE GREASED CAKE PAN.
STEP 6: BAKE THE CAKE: PLACE THE CAKE PAN IN THE PREHEATED OVEN. SET THE TIMER BASED ON THE BAKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SPECIFIC CAKE RECIPE. ALLOW THE CAKE TO BAKE UNTIL A TOOTHPICK INSERTED INTO THE CENTER COMES OUT CLEAN.
STEP 7: COOL THE CAKE: ONCE THE CAKE IS BAKED, REMOVE IT FROM THE OVEN. LET IT COOL IN THE PAN FOR A FEW MINUTES. TRANSFER THE CAKE ONTO A WIRE RACK TO COOL COMPLETELY.
STEP 8: PREPARE THE FROSTING: CHOOSE A FROSTING RECIPE (E.G., BUTTERCREAM, CREAM CHEESE). GATHER THE NECESSARY INGREDIENTS FOR THE SELECTED FROSTING. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO PREPARE THE FROSTING.
STEP 9: FROST AND DECORATE THE CAKE: ONCE THE CAKE HAS COOLED, APPLY THE FROSTING EVENLY ON TOP AND AROUND THE SIDES. USE CAKE DECORATING TOOLS, SUCH AS PIPING BAGS OR SPATULAS, TO CREATE DESIRED DECORATIONS OR PATTERNS.

Q: A speeding motorist travelling at 120 km/hr passes a stopped police car. The police car immediately begins to chase the speeder, accelerating at a constant 2.5 m/s. How long does it take for the police car to intercept the speeder?
STEP 1: CONVERT UNITS: CONVERT THE SPEED OF THE MOTORIST FROM KM/HR TO M/S TO ENSURE CONSISTENT UNITS OF MEASUREMENT.
STEP 2: FIND RELATIVE VELOCITY: DETERMINE THE RELATIVE VELOCITY BETWEEN THE POLICE CAR AND THE SPEEDER BY SUBTRACTING THE SPEED OF THE SPEEDER FROM THE ACCELERATION OF THE POLICE CAR.
STEP 3: CALCULATE TIME: USE THE FORMULA T = D/V, WHERE T IS THE TIME, D IS THE DISTANCE, AND V IS THE RELATIVE VELOCITY, TO CALCULATE THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THE POLICE CAR TO INTERCEPT THE SPEEDER.
STEP 4: SUBSTITUTE VALUES: SUBSTITUTE THE KNOWN VALUES INTO THE FORMULA: THE DISTANCE IS NOT GIVEN, BUT WE CAN ASSUME IT IS ZERO SINCE THE POLICE CAR STARTS CHASING THE SPEEDER WHEN THEY PASS EACH OTHER. THE RELATIVE VELOCITY IS DETERMINED IN STEP 2.
STEP 5: SOLVE FOR TIME: SOLVE THE EQUATION OBTAINED IN STEP 4 TO FIND THE TIME IT TAKES FOR THE POLICE CAR TO INTERCEPT THE SPEEDER.
